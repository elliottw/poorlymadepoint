      <description>Mark Cuban: It&amp;#39;s not the wealthy taking the hit.
I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of articles where rich people (aka investors) are saying that the govt needs to rescue Silicon Valley Bank, otherwise a lot of poor people (aka people who work) will suffer far more than the rich people making these claims. At first glance, this seems to make sense. Rich people are rich, they&amp;#39;ll always be rich and most of their money isn&amp;#39;t in a bank anyway.</description>
